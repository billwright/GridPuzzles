Feature: Example usage
  As a BDD enthusiast,
  I want to learn all the features of pytest-bdd,
  So I can learn new things and get tasks done.

  # The "@" annotations are tags
  # One feature can have multiple scenarios
  # The lines immediately after the feature title are just comments

  @example
  Scenario: Say Hi
    Given I say hi
    Given I print the world
    Given I say "sup"
